# Scientific Data Analysis Workshop1 (Binder-ready)

This repository was developed as an educational tutorial/workshop for the Scientific Data Analysis course (6003ESC) offered to Honours students at Griffith University.  
It is loosely based on Software Carpentry teaching material and other online resources and is setup to be run live and interactively in class using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
